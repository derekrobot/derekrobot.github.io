It's a strange origin story, but a combination of meeting a pilot and playing too much GTA got me interested in aviation. I took my first discovery flight at KXLL in 2017, and another in 2018 in a '68 Navajo. 

I'm currently working on a sport license with Gateway Aviation at KXLL. The Evektor Sportstar I'm flying is an awesome aircraft. It has a great interior and it's responsive to fingertip pressure. The only issues I've noticed so far are difficult to adjust rudder pedals and an annoying screw throtle.
