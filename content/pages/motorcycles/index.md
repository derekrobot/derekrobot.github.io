My current motorcycle is a 1991 Honda Nighthawk 250. It admittedly was an impulse buy, but I still love the bike. It did initially need the carb and forks rebuilt. My only real complaint is how light it feels; I really get blown around by the wind. I strapped a box to the bag for cargo, which I think is much more versatile than small softbags. It was originally red, but I plasti-dipped it white with rattle cans.
