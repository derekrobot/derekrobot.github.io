I’ve been a member of the NCC Fab Lab since 2014. The Fab Lab is a community workshop that has a team of expert teachers. I started with an electric guitar building class, and branched out to other technologies in the lab like 3d printing, laser cutting, moldmaking, machining, etc. So far, I’ve co-taught a 3d printing and a drone class, and have gotten to attend awesome events like the World Maker Faire.
