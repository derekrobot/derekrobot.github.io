This recording was taken in early 2020 from my 2005 Harley Sportster 883. It had a carburetted [Evolution engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harley-Davidson_Evolution_engine), Vance and Hines Short Shot exhaust, and no baffles. Obnoxiously loud in hindsight, and I wouldn't straight-pipe another vehicle; the novelty quickly wore off and I felt guilty during late-night commutes.
