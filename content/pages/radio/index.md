I originally wanted to get an amateur license in 2017 for drone flights. W3OK happened to be starting a technician license class at that time, which I took. During the class, I took the General test at another club and upgraded to Extra during the final class. I still havenâ€™t done much with the license besides a few FT-8 contacts on the club radio.
