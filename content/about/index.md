# About the website

I started this website as a hobby project, then continued updating it as a hobby and platform to post my thoughts. Until college, I struggled with writing actual content, and mainly focused on constantly rewriting code for the site. One thing I really enjoy about running a personal website is that I donâ€™t really have to worry about things like broken links and downtime; it mostly exists for my sake. 

It's running Hugo with a custom theme. I wrote it from scratch, and it initially started as a clone of [Octopress](https://github.com/parsiya/Hugo-Octopress). Over time, it was continually updated to reflect my personal style. I chose Octopress because it strongly resembled Apple's old skeuomorphic design, but my preferred style ended up evolving into a modern, reasonable dark theme.
