(I prefer kWh over MJ #sorrynotsorry)</p><p>A street-legal Honda Clarity FCEV holds 5.46kg of compressed hydrogen gas, or 214kWh:</p><p>$$5.46kg~H_2*\frac{1000g}{1kg}*\frac{1mol~H_2}{2.016g}*\frac{285kJ}{1mol~H_2}*\frac{1kWh}{3600kJ}\approx214kWh$$</p><p>A 2020 F1 car holds 105kg of premium gasoline, or 1,321kWh:</p><p>$$105kg~gasoline*\frac{1L}{0.75kg}*\frac{9.5kWh}{1L}\approx1,321kWh$$</p><figure><img src=formulaecar.jpg alt="2nd generation Formula E car [5]"><figcaption><p>2nd generation Formula E car [5]</p></figcaption></figure><h2 id=efficiency-and-power-output>Efficiency and power output</h2><p>Fuel cells are only 60% efficient according to the US Dept. of Energy [1], but that&rsquo;s still ~2.5x the usable amount of energy as a current Formula E car (ignoring the real battery&rsquo;s internal resistance, so the actual number is even better than 2.5x).</p><p>The Clarity&rsquo;s fuel cell outputs 100kW continuous, and only weighs 52kg. [2] It uses a 1.7kWh buffer battery to feed the motor, which is similar to the 1kWh supercapacitor F1 cars use for their MGU-K boost motor. Formula E cars use their 54kWh battery for a 45 minute race, so the average power is 72kW:</p><p>$$\bar{P}=\frac{54kWh}{0.75h}=72kW$$</p><p>The Clarity fuel cell&rsquo;s average power output should be sufficient for a race, but the Formula E car would probably need a larger supercapacitor to handle the 250kW bursts. Luckily, the 52kg fuel cell would be replacing a 250kg battery, so there should be plenty of room for a capacitor energy store.</p><h2 id=safety>Safety</h2><figure><img src=Honda_FCX_platform_rear_Honda_Collection_Hall.jpg alt="Honda Clarity hydrogen tanks inside ladder frame [5]. Not much protection compared to a racecar!"><figcaption><p>Honda Clarity hydrogen tanks inside ladder frame [5]. Not much protection compared to a racecar!</p></figcaption></figure><p>Safety is a huge consideration with hydrogen fuel. F1 cars put their fuel tanks inside the monocoque (&ldquo;safety cell&rdquo;), behind the driver&rsquo;s seat. The system isn&rsquo;t foolproof; when Romain Grosjean crashed in 2020, his fuel system burst and there was a huge fire. Hydrogen could be a potential safety upgrade: Toyota shot their hydrogen tank with a .50 caliber round and it didn&rsquo;t explode. [4] A fuel cell electric vehicle doesn&rsquo;t have a hot exhaust to serve as an ignition source, and there isn&rsquo;t 105kg of gasoline ready to coat the driver in case of a tank failure; hydrogen is the lightest gas/element in the universe. One safety hazard is water production: a Honda Clarity outputs roughly 50L of water per tank of hydrogen, which would need to be dumped somewhere other than the racetrack.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>With some modification, the hydrogen power source from a normal Honda Clarity should be sufficient to power a Formula E car. The higher available energy could lead to faster, longer, and more exciting races, and street-legal spec powertrains would further the FIA&rsquo;s goal of using Formula E as a laboratory to develop more environmentally-friendly street cars. To be clear, I&rsquo;m not <a href=/pages/serieshybrids>advocating</a> for hydrogen as a replacement for battery electric vehicles or hybrids; this is just a thought experiment about electric racing.</p><hr><p>[1] <a href=https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2015/11/f27/fcto_fuel_cells_fact_sheet.pdf>https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2015/11/f27/fcto_fuel_cells_fact_sheet.pdf</a></p><p>[2] <a href=https://owners.honda.com/vehicles/information/2019/Clarity%20Fuel%20Cell/specs#mid%5EZC4F8KGNW>https://owners.honda.com/vehicles/information/2019/Clarity%20Fuel%20Cell/specs#mid^ZC4F8KGNW</a></p><p>[3] <a href=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Honda_FCX_platform_rear_Honda_Collection_Hall.jpg>&ldquo;Honda FCX platform rear Honda Collection Hall&rdquo;</a> by <a href=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Morio>Morio</a> is licensed under <a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en>CC BY-SA 3.0</a>.</p><p>[4] <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVeagFmmwA0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVeagFmmwA0</a></p><p>[5] &ldquo;Formula E Car&rdquo; by Dave Hamster is licensed with CC BY 2.0.
