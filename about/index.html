Until college, I struggled with writing actual content, and mainly focused on constantly rewriting code for the site. One thing I really enjoy about running a personal website is that I don’t have to worry about things like broken links and downtime; it mostly exists for my sake.</p><p>It&rsquo;s running Hugo with a custom theme. I wrote it from scratch, and it initially started as a clone of <a href=https://github.com/parsiya/Hugo-Octopress>Octopress</a>. Over time, it was continually updated to reflect my personal style. I chose Octopress because it strongly resembled Apple&rsquo;s old skeuomorphic design, but my preferred style ended up evolving into a modern, reasonable dark theme.</p></section></div></main><footer><span>&copy;2018-2021 Derek Richline </span><a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/><img alt="Creative Commons License" style=border-width:0 src=https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by/4.0/80x15.png></a><br><span>Served with care.</span></footer></body></html>
